How to use:

1) Edit the script to modify the Tabs names (titles) and how many tabs you need to create.
2) Give it execution permissions with: chmod +x pretabs-kitty.sh
3) Execute the script and it will autocreate the predefined tabs in Kitty.

Optional:
Add this script as a function in your .zshrc to execute it more easily.
